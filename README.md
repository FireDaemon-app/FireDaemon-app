# FireDaemon 2.52 Stable Build Latest Version

FireDaemon enables you to configure any application, program, or script to run as a native Windows service without requiring programmatic modifications. Once established, FireDaemon Pro securely operates your application on Session 0, starting it at system boot without the need for user login. Additionally, FireDaemon Pro monitors your program, automatically restarting it in case of crashes or failures. Whether your program is designed to run indefinitely or completes after a finite duration, FireDaemon ensures seamless operation.

FireDaemon includes an advanced scheduling engine, offering features such as duration-based scheduling, timed restarts, and point-in-time executions. You can manage both FireDaemon Pro and native Windows services using the GUI, command-line interface (CLI), or FireDaemon Pro OEM for branding, integration, and bundling with your platform or product.
